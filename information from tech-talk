When you ssh to the device you are implicitly using port 22. 
You don’t want to use port 5064, that is for EPICS TCP messages, not for communicating with the device.
//////////////
EPICS_CA_AUTO_ADDR_LIST=YES
EPICS_CA_ADDR_LIST="192.168.163.97 192.168.163.255"

What is the network configuration of the IOC machine and the medm machine?  Are they running on the 

1) Same computer
2) Different computer on same subnet
3) Different computers on different subnets?

If 1) or 2) then you should not set the EPICS_CA_ADDR_LIST environment variables at all, the defaults should work.
If 2) then you may need to disable iptables on both machines.

No route to host qusetion

caget uses ports 5064 and 5065 by default.  It uses UDP to locate which IOC has the PV, and then TCP to read the value.


The fact that you can ping makes it sound like there is a firewall somewhere blocking ports 5064 or 5065.  Those both need to be open for both UDP and TCP.
